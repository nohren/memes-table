## Architecture

This project is meant to be lightweight, simple, and sustainable.

Setup is via
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-deploy-your-react-app-from-scratch-using-webpack-and-babel-a669891033d4/

## Setup

1. Open a terminal at this directory
2. Check if you have npm, in the terminal type `npm -v`. If nothing, install npm globally via npm website instructions.
3. Install node modules - `npm install`
4. Serve project - `npm run start`
5. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Note, I changed the port to 3000 since 8080 conflicts with Mac OS Sonoma and greater.
6. Start work - Locate ./SRC directory and modify JS/CSS files within there.
