        From Rue Assouli, in Rabat's Melah, to Sderot Israel, to Alameda, our
        family has journeyed halfway across the world in search of a better
        life, carrying with us traditions that span centuries. Nowhere is this
        heritage more alive than in the aromas of our mothers’ and grandmothers’
        kitchens. Voices of Mimouna is both a digital kitchen companion and a
        living family archive, preserving the flavors, stories, and rituals of
        Moroccan-Israeli cuisine. With each recipe comes a voice, a memory, and
        a gentle guide at your side.

        What is Mimouna? Mimouna is a joyful celebration held the evening after
        Passover ends, rooted in the traditions of Moroccan Jewry and now
        embraced in Israel and around the world. Families open their homes to
        friends and neighbors, offering tables overflowing with sweets,
        pastries, and symbols of luck and abundance — especially mufleta, a soft
        pancake served with honey or butter. It’s more than a feast; it’s a
        moment of open doors, open hearts, and shared blessings for health,
        prosperity, and togetherness. For our family, Mimouna is both a link to
        our Moroccan heritage and a reminder that food and hospitality are
        central to our hearts and our identity.
