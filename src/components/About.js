        This is our story. From Rue Assouli, in the Melah of Rabat, to Sderot
        Israel, to Alameda, our family has journeyed halfway across the world in
        search of a better life. We carry with us traditions that span
        centuries. Pinch of Melah is a way of preserving the heritage of our
        mothers’ and grandmothers’ kitchens. It is a living family archive full
        of flavors, stories, and rituals of Moroccan-Jewish cuisine. With each
        recipe will come a voice, a memory, and a gentle guide at your side.

        A Third Culture Kid (TCK) is a person who has spent a significant part
        of their developmental years in a culture different from their parents'
        passport country, creating their own unique "third" culture. TCK has
        defined the experience of our first generation parents and has had a
        lesser but still present part on the second generation. As we trend into
        the 3rd generation, we provide a tender guiding hand to those who seek
        their living breathing roots.

        In capturing our culinary traditions, we also embrace open hearts, and
        shared blessings for health, prosperity, and togetherness. For our
        family, it is both a link to our Moroccan heritage and a reminder that
        food and hospitality are central to our essence and our identity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shalom u'bracha (peace and blessings) to all who visit.
